# Project 1 - Wordle

Submitted by: Deep Mistry

Wordle is an app that mimicks the Wordle game that has been made popular over the past couple years. This app gives the user 6 tries to guess a word that is pre-determined by the app and for each guess by the user, the app gives hints as to what letters are in the word but not in the right place, in the word and in the right place, or not in the word at all. 

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Notes

The comment description for exercise 4 was a bit too vague/misleading in my opinion and took me quite a lot of time to figure out.
